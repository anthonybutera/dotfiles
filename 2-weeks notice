2-weeks notice

TLDR: - Not enough of what I want, too much of what I don't ... we're being treated like children



PROS:
- Respectable salary for the role
- Tolerable working hours
	- Little management interference
- Amount of work during shift is light
	- Sometimes, too much so
- NSOC office room is delightully cold in the later hours
- Some staff are tolerable
	- A few like-minded co-workers that want better for themselves
- Hardee's chicken soft tacos



CONS: 
- After many months, NSOC department is going nowhere, not being developed at all
- No meaningful work: mindless, automatable busy work (tickets / timelines) instead of system administration level stuff
- No purposeful career path or advancement opportunities
- Management is either non-transparent, incompetent or are control freaks
- Management is not open to suggestions for improvement, unless it solely benefits them
	- Welcomed the recommendation of getting more NSOC responsibility, no extra benefits
	- Refused the suggestion of automating ticket creation because "not passionate about it"
	- Delayed because "no runbook" and no one followed up
		- Been denied by Lynn Hall or put off by Tony Serrano too many times
- All decisions for the 3 adjacent Service Desk departments (L1's / L2's, NSOC, Access Management) are made by 1 person
	- Everyone is afraid of Lynn Hall
- Most co-workers are low effort / quality / don't give a shit
- NSOC office room and desks are uncomfortable
- Only 30 minutes for lunch
- Lack of proper parking in rear of building is a nightmare for 2nd shift
- No work from home, even as an option
	- (despite Citrix environment used during COVID-19)
- Too much email
	- NSOC is on all Service Desk email distribution lists
- Access to systems is unnecessarily denied 
	- SSH to the SDWAN routers just to force us to use the web GUI
	- VPN was restricted just to force us to use Citrix
		- Citrix program installation / usage is even further restricted
		- Cannot ping outside of the RTG network
- Websites restrictions are unnecessary, non-uniform and targeted in some cases
	- Block debian.org because I use it with Windows Subsystem for Linux 
		- But per IT Security "MIS is allowed to download and install software"
	- Block gmail.com and other webmail services because we said so 
	



Bottom line:
- Not getting enough of what I need or want to continue working here
- We're looked at and treated like children
